Lab 8.5 – Cell Phone Minute Calculator
--------------------------------------
Design and write a program that calculates and displays the number of minutes
    over the monthly contract minutes that a cell phone user incurred.  The
    program should ask the user how many minutes were used during the month
    and how many minutes they were allowed.  Validate the input as follows:

• The minimum minutes allowed should be at least 200, but not greater than
    800.  Validate input so that the minutes allowed are between 200 and 800.
• The minutes used must be over 0.  Validate input so that the user does not
    enter a negative value.

Once correct data is entered, the program should calculate the number of
    minutes over the minute allowed.  If minutes were not over, print a
    message that they were not over the limit.  If minutes were over, for
    every minute over, a .20 fee should be added to the monthly contract rate
    of 74.99.  Be sure not to add the .20 fee for minutes 1 to the number of
    minutes allowed, but rather just minutes over.  Display the number of
    minutes used, minutes allowed, the number of minutes over, and the total
    due that month.

You might consider the following functions:
• A function that allows the user to enter in minutes allowed within the range of 200 and 800.
• A function that allows the user to enter in the minutes used greater than or equal to 0.
• A function that calculates the total due and the total minutes over.
• A function that prints a monthly use report.
